The model focuses on predicting the crop yield in advance by analyzing factors like district (assuming same weather and soil parameters in a particular district), state, season, crop type using various supervised machine learning techniques. This helps the farmers to know the crop yield in advance to plan and choose a crop that would give a better yield.
